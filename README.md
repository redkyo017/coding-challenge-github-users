# Heftybyte At Home Coding Challenge

### Challenge:  Github User List

### Focus: Javascript
### Time: 2hrs
### Challenge:

Build a simple web app that lists Github users sorted by the number of repos they have. The UI should consist of:

- an input search box for users to enter a comma separated list of Github usernames into
- a button to start the search
- a vertical list of usernames along with number of repos below the search

Github has an open JSON API exposed over HTTPS. To fetch user data, use the /users endpoint with the Github username as the last path part like so:

**Request**

`https://api.github.com/users/esco`

**Response**
```json
{
  "login": "esco",
  "id": 375773,
  "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/375773?v=4",

### Submission
Push your code to this repo within 2hrs after starting.

### Take Note

The challenge may seem simple, but keep in mind we are judging the following factors:

- Code Quality (clean code)
- Performance (bandwidth, latency..etc)
- Code Organization (excellent code structure)
- Proficiency with JavaScript (modern features)

Bring your best talent to this task! We care much more about these factors than we do about 100% functionality.

**Good Luck!**
